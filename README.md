# My SaaS App ðŸš€

This project is based on Adrian Hajdin's [SaaS App Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_LINK).  
I cloned the base version to understand full-stack SaaS development and am actively customizing features to make it my own.

## ðŸ”§ Stack Used
- Next.js
- Supabase
- Stripe
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- shadcn/ui

## âœ… What Iâ€™ve Customized So Far:
- Changed the landing page branding
- Tweaked the pricing table
- Added comments + folder cleanup

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This
I'm building real-world SaaS projects to sharpen my full-stack skills and prepare for internship roles.
